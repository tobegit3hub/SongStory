[00:15.70]When minutes become hours
[00:19.84]When days become years
[00:24.57]And I don't know where you are
[00:28.16]Color seems so dull without you
[00:33.86]Have we lost our minds?
[00:38.41]What have we done?
[00:42.16]But it all doesn't seem to matter
[00:46.81]anymore
[00:51.32]When you kissed me on that street,
[00:54.17]I kissed you back
[00:56.50]You held me in your arms,
[00:58.45]I held you in mine
[01:00.81]You picked me up
[01:03.16]to lay me down
[01:05.00]When I look into your eyes
[01:07.60]I can hear you cry for a bit more of you
[01:13.06]and I'm drenched in your love
[01:18.93]I'm no longer able to hold it back
[01:24.85]
[01:37.30]Is it too late to ask for love?
[01:41.56]Is it wrong to feel right?
[01:46.10]When the world is winding down
[01:49.91]Thoughts of you linger around
[01:55.51]Have we lost our minds?
[01:59.99]What have we done?
[02:03.98]But it all doesn¡¯t seem to matter

[02:13.28]When you kissed me on that street,
